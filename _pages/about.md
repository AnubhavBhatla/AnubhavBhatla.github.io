Hey! I am Anubhav, a fourth-year undergraduate at the Department of the Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering with Honours, and a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am deeply interested in the research area of Computer Architecture, which involves a good mix of fascinating topics in Electrical and Computer Science. I am currently working on research topics in Microarchitectural security, which involves designing cache structures to ensure security against various side-channel attacks.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading books (mostly fiction) and follow sports such as tennis, cricket, and badminton. I have also completed one year of training under the National Cadet Corps (NCC) at IIT Bombay.

Research Interests:
------------------
* Computer Architecture
