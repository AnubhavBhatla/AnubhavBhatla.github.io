Hey! I am Anubhav, a fourth-year undergraduate at the Department of the Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. I am pursuing an Integrated B.Tech + M.Tech Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering with a specialisation in Electronic Systems, and a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering.

I am deeply interested in the research area of Computer Architecture, which involves a good mix of fascinating topics in Electrical and Computer Science. I am currently working on research topics in Hardware Security, designing cache structures to ensure security against various side-channel attacks.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading books (mostly fiction) and follow sports such as tennis, cricket, and badminton. I have also completed one year of training under the National Cadet Corps (NCC) at IIT Bombay.

Research Interests:
------------------
* Computer Systems and Architecture
* Hardware Security

In pursuit of these interests, I have been a part of the following research groups:

* [CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io/) - Computer Architecture for Security and Performance Group - [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/)
* [Memory Systems Lab](https://memlab.ece.gatech.edu) - [Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi](https://moin.cc.gatech.edu)
* [High Performance Processor Architecture and Compilation Lab] - [Prof. Dean Tullsen](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~tullsen/index.html)
* [CADSL](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~cadsl/index.php) - Computer Architecture and Dependable Systems Lab - [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/)
* [CY-PHY](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~stallur/index.php/) - Cyber Physical Systems Lab - [Prof. Siddharth Tallur](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/siddharth-tallur/)
