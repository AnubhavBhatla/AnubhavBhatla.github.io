Hey! I am Anubhav, a first-year EECS Ph.D. student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with [Prof. Mengjia Yan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mengjia/). I previously completed my Bachelors and Masters from the Department of the Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, with [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/) as my thesis advisor.

I am deeply interested in the research area of Computer Architecture, which involves a good mix of fascinating topics in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am currently working on research topics in Reliability of accelerators against silent data corruptions. I have previously explored Hardware Security, designing cache structures to ensure security against various side-channel attacks and branch predictor partitioning techniques for security and performance.

Outside of academics, I enjoy going to the gym, reading books (mostly fiction) and play sports such as tennis, squash, and badminton. I have also completed one year of training under the National Cadet Corps (NCC) at IIT Bombay.

Research Interests:
------------------
* Computer Systems and Architecture
* Reliability
* Hardware Security

In pursuit of these interests, I have been a part of the following research groups:

* [MATCHA](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mengjia/) - Microarchitecture Attacks and Challenges Group - [Prof. Mengjia Yan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mengjia/)
* [CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io/) - Computer Architecture for Security and Performance Group - [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/)
* [Memory Systems Lab](https://memlab.ece.gatech.edu) - [Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi](https://moin.cc.gatech.edu)
* [PACL](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/pacl/) - High Performance Processor Architecture and Compilation Lab - [Prof. Dean Tullsen](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~tullsen/index.html)
