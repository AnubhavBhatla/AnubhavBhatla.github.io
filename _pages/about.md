Hey! I am Anubhav, a fifth-year undergraduate at the Department of the Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. I am pursuing an Integrated Bachelors + Masters of Technology (Dual Degree) in Electrical Engineering with a specialisation in Electronic Systems, and a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I will be joining Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pursue a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. hi

I am deeply interested in the research area of Computer Architecture, which involves a good mix of fascinating topics in Electrical and Computer Science. I am currently working on research topics in Hardware Security, designing cache structures to ensure security against various side-channel attacks. I am also exploring branch predictor partitioning techniques for security and performance.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading books (mostly fiction) and follow sports such as tennis, cricket, and badminton. I have also completed one year of training under the National Cadet Corps (NCC) at IIT Bombay.

Research Interests:
------------------
* Computer Systems and Architecture
* Hardware Security
* VLSI Circuit Design

In pursuit of these interests, I have been a part of the following research groups:

* [MATCHA](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mengjia/) - Microarchitecture Attacks and Challenges Group - [Prof. Mengjia Yan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mengjia/)
* [FLAME](https://flame.csail.mit.edu) - Foundations of Languages and Machines Lab - [Prof. Rachit Nigam](https://rachit.pl)
* [CASPER](https://casper-iitb.github.io/) - Computer Architecture for Security and Performance Group - [Prof. Biswabandan Panda](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~biswa/)
* [Memory Systems Lab](https://memlab.ece.gatech.edu) - [Prof. Moinuddin Qureshi](https://moin.cc.gatech.edu)
* [PACL](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/pacl/) - High Performance Processor Architecture and Compilation Lab - [Prof. Dean Tullsen](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~tullsen/index.html)
