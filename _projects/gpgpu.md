I worked on this project as part of a Summer Project with Prof. Virendra Singh. I had been tasked with understanding and implementing an Adaptive decoupled last-level cache design for general-purpose GPUs. Since GPUs were a new topic for me at the time, I studied and reviewed the 
Studied and reviewed the SIMT Core, Memory systems and the programming model related to GP-GPU architecture. I also reviewd literature about leveraging Adaptive last-level caching and implementing it on the GPGPU-Sim simulator. I also performed various benchamrk simulations on the simulator and carefully analyzed the outputs received.
