_Guides: [Prof. Amit Sethi](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/)_  

This was a course project as part of the course EE338: Digital Signal Processing taught by Prof. Vikram Gadre. We were required to design and implement a dual-band filter using Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptical, and FIR filter design techniques. We also made a comparion of these design techniques based on their order, transition width, passband, stopband, and phase response.
