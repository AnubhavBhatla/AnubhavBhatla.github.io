I am working on this project as part of the course EE618: CMOS Analog VLSI Design taken by Prof. Rajesh Zele. To get us familiarized with Virtuoso, we were tasked with design the schematic and layout for a CMOS Inverter with specified rise and fall times. We were also required to perform post-layout simulations by incorporating parasitic capacitances and observing the change in the output voltage. 
The next task I'll be working on is to design and simulate a 2-stage OTA for the given parameters of noise, gain, slew rate, unity gain frequency, and phase margin.
