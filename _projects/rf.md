I worked on this project as part of the course EE619: RF Microelectronics Chip Design taken by Prof. Rajesh Zele. To get us familiarized with Virtuoso, we were tasked with design the schematic for a Common-Source LNA in UMC 65nm technology with the given specifications.
The final project was to design and simulate a Cross-coupled Voltage-controlled Oscillator for the given parameters of frequency, phase noise, $K_{VCO}$, voltage swing, and power dissipation. The final layout for the OTA had a 1.08V swing, $K_{VCO}$ of 61MHz/V, 28MHz tuning range, and a phase noise of -117dBc/Hz at a 1MHz relative frequency.
