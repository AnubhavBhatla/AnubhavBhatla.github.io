_Guide: [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/)_  

This was a course project as part of the course EE677: VLSI CAD taught by Prof. Virendra Singh. The project involved implementing graph partitioning algorithms and heuristics like the Kernighan-Lin Algorithm, Clustering Based Heuristic, Hagen Kahng EIG Algorithm and comparing their capability in partitioning a given graph network into two partitions. We also visualise them using plotting tools of matplotlib and networkx Python libraries.
