_Guide: [Prof. Dean Tullsen](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tullsen/)_  

Half&Half is a novel technique that reverse-engineers modern branch predictors, identifying a simple way to partition the predictor space across two processes running in SMT mode. I am currently working on improving this partitioning algorithm to optimized the number of NOPs required. I am also working on identifying hot branches in a workload to separate them in order to improve their misprediction rate and thus improve performance.
