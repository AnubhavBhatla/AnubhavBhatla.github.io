This project was taken up as part of the course EE746: Neuromorphic Engineering by Prof. Udayan Ganguly. The problem statement was to implement Spiking Equilibrium Propagation using the 45nm CMOS technology. The original paper had shown the CMOS implementation using a 65nm technology. Using our novel implementation of the Equi-Prop system in 45nm technology, we were able to simulate the synapse between two neurons. The circuit consumes a total power of 82.65uW and the synapse circuit only uses about 8.79uW of this.
