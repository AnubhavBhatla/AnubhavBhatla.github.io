I am Anubhav, a fourth-year undergraduate at the Department of the Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering with Honours, and a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering.</p> <p>I am deeply interested in the research area of Computer Architecture, which involves a good mix of fascinating topics in Electrical and Computer Science. I am currently working on research topics in Microarchitectural security, which involves designing cache structures to ensure security against various side-channel attacks.</p> <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy reading books (mostly fiction) and follow sports such as tennis, cricket, and badminton. I have also completed one year of training under the National Cadet Corps (NCC) at IIT Bombay.</p> <h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests:</h2> <ul> <li>Computer Architecture</li> <li>Microarchitectural Security</li> <li>Digital Design</li> <li>Microprocessors</li> </ul> <h2 id="research-groups">Research Groups:</h2> <ul> <li> <a href="https://casper-iitb.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CASPER</a> - Computer Architecture for Security and Performance Group - Prof. Biswabandan Panda</li> <li> <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~cadsl/index.php" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CADSL</a> - Computer Architecture and Dependable Systems Lab - Prof. Virendra Singh</li> <li> <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~stallur/contact/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CPS</a> - Cyber-Physical Systems Lab - Prof. Siddharth Tallur</li> </ul> <hr> <p>Please find my CV <a href="https://anubhavbhatla.github.io/files/CV.pdf">here</a> <em>(last updated on 20th July 2023)</em></p> <hr> </body></html>
